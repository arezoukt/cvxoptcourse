= Course information

== Course Structure
- Lectures: pre-recorded lectures uploaded weekly. There will be weekly live discussion sessions where Dr. Keshavarz will work through examples and answer questions. These will be held on Google Meet, *Wednesdays 2:30-3:30pm*. 
- TA office hours/tutorials: Mohammad (XX), Sajad (XX). These will also be held on Google Meet. 
- Course Requirements and grading:
-- Bi-Weekly homework assignments, due on Fridays at midnight, starting on XX of Esfand. *Late homework will not be accepted.* You are allowed, even encouraged, to work on the homework in small groups, but you must write up your own homework to hand in. Homework will be graded on a scale of 0â€“4. We will have 8-10 homeworks throughout the term and will consider the average grade of these homeworks towards the total grade. 
-- Midterm quiz. The midterm will be scheduled at the end of Farvardin or early Ordibehesht. 
-- Final. The final date will be announced here. 

== Prerequisites
- Good knowledge of linear algebra, and exposure to probability. Exposure to numerical computing, optimization, and application fields helpful but not required; the applications will be kept basic and simple.
- You will use one of [http://cvxr.com/cvx/ CVX] (Matlab) or [https://www.cvxpy.org/ CVXPY] (Python) to write simple scripts, so basic familiarity with elementary programming will be required. We refer to CVX and CVXPY collectively as CVX*.

== Lecture videos
 These will be shared with you on Google drive (through a google account) and you will get a link for these early on in the course. Note that you need to give us a gmail address to share these files with you. 
 
== TA homework sessions 
These will not be held online. Instead, we will post videos of the homework sessions after the due date (similar to lecture videos). Again, these will be on Google Drive.
