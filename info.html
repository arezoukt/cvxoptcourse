<h1>Course information</h1>

<h2>Course structure </h2>

place on Mondays TBD at TBD. Attendance is strongly encouraged.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The TAs will be holding biweekly problem solving sessions a few days before

learning and growth. These will take place on Wednesdays at TBD.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course Requirements and Grading</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Bi-Weekly homework assignments (25%), due on Fridays at midnight. 
The first homework will be due on 5th of Esfand. <b>Late homework will not be accepted,
except in family or medical emergency and must be approved by the instructor
directly ahead of time.</b> You are allowed, even encouraged, to work on the
homework in small groups, but you must write up your own homework to hand in.
Homework will be graded on a scale of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. We will have 8-10 homeworks
throughout the term and will consider the average grade of these homeworks
towards the total grade.  </p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: In case of plagiarism, you may lose the full grade of that 
homework, or possibly all homework assignments.</b></p>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>Midterm (20%): We will have a 1.5-hour in-class midterm exam. It will most likely take place on 21st of Farvardin after the Norooz holidays.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Projects (25%): We will assign project questions throughout the term. 
We expect to assign around 4-5 project assignments throughout the term.
Late submission of these will not be accepted. These may be assigned
at the same time as a homework, but you should work on them independently. Note
that the write-up for  these questions will be very very clear, so we will not
answer any questions or give any hints about them. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Final exam (30%): We will have a 2-hour in-class final exam, to be taken in the first or second week of Khordad. The date will most likely be on Monday
8th of Khordad.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we reserve the right to change the weights during the semester.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Good knowledge of linear algebra, and exposure to probability. Exposure to
numerical computing, optimization, and application fields helpful but not
required; the applications will be kept basic and simple.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You will use one of <a href="http://cvxr.com/cvx/">CVX</a> (Matlab) or
<a href="https://www.cvxpy.org/">CVXPY</a> (Python) to write simple scripts, so basic
familiarity with elementary programming will be required. We refer to CVX and
CVXPY collectively as CVX*.</p>
